# FrontEnd
Welcome to the Complete front end development Bootcamp. This is one of the most comprehensive bootcamp available online. So, if you are new to web development, thats great news because starting from scratch is always easy. And if you have tried some other courses before, you already know that web development is not easy. This is because of 2 reasons. Either the web development course might be missing projects, or might be focusing on too many things at a time. When you focus on everything, in a short duration of time, it is very tough be a great developer.

This course gives you a unique experience and focus only on front end web development. First we will get professional and free web development tools, then we will start with HTML. Once we cover this ground, we will take down our very first challenge. Further we will learn HTML 5 and start our first project. 

Moving further we will take CSS and CSS3. After that we will have a complete and dedicated section on projects. After that we will learn Bootstrap and optimise our sites for mobile view. After that we will learn Javascript and jQuery and will do some projects in that.

Structure of this is designed after research and you will never feel bore in this course. After completion of the course, you will be able to design a web page in the exact same design that is on your mind or you might have seen on some theme website. 

Creating a web template of your own or edit the one, you will be a full skill ninja to do the job. 

Our offline bootcamps are priced at 1000$ per student but with online education, you can get the exact same content in fractions of that.
